fix "cls/clear" calls with a nicer printing system. (Possibly redrawing characters instead of clearing screen)

general:
    - move /cli.cpp/h files to /cli/src
    - by default, do not build the cli tool. Set it behind a cmake variable
    - implement utility functions:
                            function to calculate md5
    - on cli macos, when running a first time boot, it doesn't properly initialize ADB
    - if there's not enough space for a download, it will fail but mark the application status as Downloaded. It should be Download error
    - make MLoaderDownloads folder hidden by default in home dir, and also lowercase
    - instead of single callbacks, use observer pattern, so any object can subscribe to any event

rclone:
    - should have report progress and complete/fail callbacks

VRPManager:
    - load json to struct
    - move findFirstFileWithExtension to some utility
    - when checking for installed packages on the device, it should also check the package version before determining if a package is installed on the device or not
            another thing, it should mark a package as installed even without it being downloaded, if the package is at the same version

gtk/linux specific:
    - make devices on device list which aren't authorized red
    - format Popularity column to 2 decimals
    - tile view
    - allow InstallingFailed state to retry installation
    - gtk make fails on fresh generate because src/resource/mloader_gtk_resources.c is missing (probably just making a dummy file is going to fix this)
    - on manjaro the initialization label on splash window was empty the entire time and the window was not centered

macOS specific:
    - use fs::create_directory (singular) when initializing the library
