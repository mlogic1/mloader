fix "cls/clear" calls with a nicer printing system. (Possibly redrawing characters instead of clearing screen)

general:
    - move /cli.cpp/h files to /cli/src
    - by default, do not build the cli tool. Set it behind a cmake variable
    - implement utility functions:
                            function to calculate md5
    - on cli macos, when running a first time boot, it doesn't properly initialize ADB
    - if there's not enough space for a download, it will fail but mark the application status as Downloaded. It should be Download error
    - make MLoaderDownloads folder hidden by default in home dir, and also lowercase
    - instead of single callbacks, use observer pattern, so any object can subscribe to any event

rclone:
    - should have report progress and complete/fail callbacks

VRPManager:
    - load json to struct
    - move findFirstFileWithExtension to some utility

gtk/linux specific:
    - standalone sideloader
    - make devices on device list which aren't authorized red
    - format Popularity column to 2 decimals
    - tile view
    - allow InstallingFailed state to retry installation
