fix "cls/clear" calls with a nicer printing system. (Possibly redrawing characters instead of clearing screen)

general:
    - move /cli.cpp/h files to /cli/src
    - by default, do not build the cli tool. Set it behind a cmake variable
    - implement a download queue to avoid concurrent downloads
    - implement utility functions:
                            function to execute shell commands
                            function to calculate md5
    - on cli macos, when running a first time boot, it doesn't properly initialize ADB

rclone:
    - should have report progress and complete/fail callbacks

VRPManager:
    - load json to struct
    - move findFirstFileWithExtension to some utility
    - implement reading notes
    - decouple RClone from VRPManager and use the UpdateAppStatus

gtk/linux specific:
    - make devices on device list which aren't authorized red
    - format Popularity column to 2 decimals
    - tile view
    - allow InstallingFailed state to retry installation
