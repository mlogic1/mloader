fix "cls/clear" calls with a nicer printing system. (Possibly redrawing characters instead of clearing screen)

general:
    - move /cli.cpp/h files to /cli/src
    - by default, do not build the cli tool. Set it behind a cmake variable
    - implement a download queue to avoid concurrent downloads
    - implement reading notes

rclone:
    - should have report progress and complete/fail callbacks

VRPManager:
    - load json to struct
    - move findFirstFileWithExtension to some utility
    - delete downloaded cache files after (a successful) extraction

Logging:
    - implement logging to file

gtk/linux specific:
    - make devices on device list which aren't authorized red
    - format Popularity column to 2 decimals
    - tile view
